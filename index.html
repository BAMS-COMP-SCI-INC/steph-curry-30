      <p>
        We should all have the power to write our own story… to choose who we
        want to become before someone decides for us. Throughout my career, I’ve
        been driven to change the narrative for the underrated and
        underrepresented by breaking down the barriers that stifle our potential
        – on and off the court.
      </p>

        We know that setting the example is far more effective than talking
        about it. This is why our relentless commitment to human equity inspires
        everything we do, with the hope that our work, in turn, inspires others
        to dream more. Through Brand, Media, Experiences, and Philanthropy, our
        aim is to create meaningful, immediate and long-lasting change in the
        world – starting with ourselves and our partners.
